# Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project
 
This file describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that I have performed to clean up the data.

The site where the data was obtained:
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

The data for the project:
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

## Instructions:

1. Download and unzip the data set.
2. Use source(run_analysis.R) command in RStudio.
3. Run the createDataSet function sending the directory of the data set as argument.
4. A new file with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject will be generated in your working directory.
5. If you want to look into the whole data set, run the cleanData function.

Read CodeBook.md to find out more about run_analysis.R.
